      </p>

      <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        The Enso Street website may use &quot;cookies&quot; to help you personalize your online experience. A
        cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot
        be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned
        to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to
        you.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time.
        The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page.
        For example, if you personalize Enso Street pages, or register with Enso Street site or
        services, a cookie helps Enso Street to recall your specific information on subsequent
        visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing
        addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Enso Street website,
        the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Enso
        Street features that you customized.
      </p>

      <p>
        You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept
        cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.
        If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive
        features of the Enso Street services or websites you visit.
      </p>

      <h2>Links</h2>
      <p>

      </p>

      <h2>Security of your Personal Information</h2>
      <p>
        Enso Street secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
        Enso street uses the following methods for this purpose:
      </p>
      <ul>SSL Protocol</ul>

        When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it
        is protected using encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.
      </p>

      <p>
        We strive to take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or
        alteration of your personal information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the
        Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we
        strive to protect your personal information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security
        and privacy limitations inherent to the Internet which are beyond our control; and (b)
        security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you

        and online services, Enso Street does not alter its practices when it receives a “Do Not
        Track” signal from a visitor’s browser except as specifically required by law. To find out
